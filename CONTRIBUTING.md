# How to Contribute
* You'll need a Github account
* You'll need to fork the Treefarm-Lite repository (If contributing code)

# Submitting Issues and Bug Reports
If reporting a bug, make sure you include the following: 
* Factorio version number
* Treefarm Lite version number
* All steps required to reproduce the bug
* What happens when the bug occurs
* what you expected to happen instead of the bug

If you cannot reproduce the bug, then describe what happens when the bug occurs, and when it seems most likely to occur. Precision and detail count!

# Making changes
* Create a branch from where you want to base your work (generally develop)
* Make commits of logical units
* Check for unnecessary whitespace before committing
* Make commit messages of a single line description of the commit, with a more detailed explanation below that if necessary 

# Submitting Changes
* Push changes to a branch in your fork of the repository
* Open a Pull Request to the main repository (likely develop branch)

# Testing Performance Changes
* Take benchmarks both before and after your changes so that the performance improvement is accurately measured
* Report UPS, FPS, and the milliseconds Treefarm takes to run per tick (the number next to the mod name in the debug F5 view)
* Slower, consistent performance w/o lag spikes is preferable to faster performance w/ lag spikes
* Measuring Performance
  * Download and install the Test Mode mod for Factorio (found here: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=2842)
  * Start a new Sandbox game
  * Explore a significant chunk of the map to force Factorio to generate the land are you will need
  * Set up the world for 2500 treefarms by running the following command in the console (accessable through '~')
    /c remote.call("treefarm_interface", "test_setup_world", 2500)
    The command will take a little while to run.
  * Double-check that enough of the world was explored to make the previous command successful by checking the generated terrain. There should be a large square of grass centered in the map. If a corner or part of an edge is missing, then explore the missing section and run the previous command again.
  * Save the game so you have a convenient point to come back to.
  * To test w/ 2500 mk1 farms, run the following command in the console
    /c remote.call("treefarm_interface", "test_create_mk1_treefarms", 2500)

  * To test w/ 2500 mk2 farms, run the following command in the console
    /c remote.call("treefarm_interface", "test_create_mk2_treefarms", 2500)
